                                            There was a day(around 2012) i was gisting with my classrep Fortune and Mercie at the front of Chemical Shed after finishing CHE 305 lecture, a young lady just walked pass us and my classrep just look at her finifini and said, who be this fine fresher babe in our department. I saw her too and my mind just told me she's the one 👌 but I did not listen to my mind😀😂❤️😍. After a year ⌚, I decided to move closer to her but this babe does not give face neither was she a smiling type. I have to use every wisdom I have to get closer to her ranging from going to her hostel to campaign for my friend(Fortune who is vying for the post of fin sec that time), inviting her to Chemical Engineering Student Convention but gbogbo ogbon ati oye did not worked out oooooo. She was hard nut to crack then. After using my whole wisdom to get her attention but all to no avail, I resolved to praying and she turned to my prayer point. During second semester 300L,that beautiful night that I was reading for CHE 304 Exam with my friend Hon Fortune at 1200 lecture theater, She just worked in and sat down at the front, when I sighted her everything i was reading did not enter again ooooo😂😂😂,i have to summon courage to meet her and collect her number, lo and behold, she gave me her number that night (My first winning)💃🤭🤗.

                                            <i>Bride:</i> SHE SAID YES!!!💞💃🤭<br>After collecting her number, I started calling her till February 2014, it's either she will not pick my call or her line will be switched off. I have to beg my friend to escort me down to her hostel so as to greet her, luckily for me, I met her but with a brother inside her room. Eyin fans mi, okan mi ti poruru as in all my thought was that the guy is her boyfriend but when I arrived the guy decided to be on his way and I heard him saying 'Anty Esther, mo ti feeee maaaa lo and she reply him Dayoshey u will not wait small ni. I feel relieved ooooo coz I realised they are brother and sister from home 🤣🤣🤣.
As a sharp shooter, I shoot my shot that night oooooo but she said she will get back to me soon, omo that's where wahala come start oooooo, osu kinin koja, mo lule osu keji koja, mo lule, osu keta tun koja, mo tun lu le ooo. After 8months of running after her, I was very very frustrated and I decided to end it. I went to my church (Oore Ofe Oluwa Baptist Church)to go and pray about it but still I'm convinced she's the one, I still continue pursuing and overtaking but still not working oo and that was when I walked up to our then student pastor in person of <b> Pastor Agunloye Taiwo </b>. I explained everything to him and he prayed along with me and gave me one wicked assignment 🤣🤣🤣. I could remember I met with him around December 28 2014 and pastor prayed for me, gave me some bible verse to use and asked me to fast on January 1st, 2nd and 3rd, ahhhhhhhhhh I should not eat nor drink anything lojo odun, my eyes turn red that day but do I have any other option??? Definitely No. I did exactly as Pastor Taiwo asked me to do and he also gave me warning not to call her nor text her during my fasting period, he said and I quote, if she's d will of God for your life, call her a day after u finished ur fasting and prayer. At exactly 10:02pm on January 5 2015,I asked her the same question have been asking for 9months plus and she said Yes that night,as in, is this how God do wonders with prayer and fasting, I was so so happy that night.
