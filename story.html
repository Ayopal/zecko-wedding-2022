                                           There was a day(around 2012) i was gisting with my friends at the front of Chemical Shed after finishing CHE 305 lecture,a young lady just walked pass us and one of my friends looked at her closely and said ‚Äúwho be this fine fresh babe‚Äù in our department, I saw her too and my mind just told me she's d one but I refused to succumb to the thought I was having in my mind. After a year, I decided to move closer to her but this babe didn‚Äôt give me any attention and the fact that she was not the smiling type made it difficult for me to accomplish my mission . I did everything possible to get closer to her from going to her hostel to campaign for my friend(Fortune who was vying for the post of fin sec that time), inviting her to Chemical Engineering Student Convention but gbogbo ogbon ati oye did not work out oooooo,she was a hard nut to crack then. After using all tactics in getting  her attention but none was working, I had to resolve to prayer, she turned to my prayer point. During second semester 300L,that beautiful night that I was reading for CHE 304 Exam with my friend Hon Fortune at 1200 lecture theater, she just worked in and sat down at the front, when I sighted her,everything i was reading did not enter again ooooo. I had to summon courage to meet her and collect her number,lo and behold,she gave me her number that night (My first win).

                                          One afternoon i logged in to Facebook only to see that one particular guy had liked almost all my pictures and commented on some. This prompted me to check his profile and I discovered we were in the same department but I didn‚Äôt know him. I knew his friend very well, Hon. Fortune who happened to be the Fin Sec of our department that year and this is someone that gave my friend and I souvenir for free during his tenureüòÅ. One day I was heading to the library after lecture when a guy approached me and before he introduced himself, I knew he was the guy that was stalking me on Facebook and he used the opportunity to tell me about the NSCHE convention that he would loved me to attend but deep down I knew it was beyond NSCHE convention and that he had another mission so I told him instantly I wouldn‚Äôt be attending. It was exam period so I went to 1200LT to read that night, seated at the front reading this same guy passed, greeted me and told me some things to read as per senior in the department and went out and on his way back he asked for my phone number and I gave him, at least for the fact that he gave me a clue of what to expect in my exam. Did I regret ever giving him my number, the answer is yes. Ever since I gave him my number he had been disturbing with calls. Brother really spent on airtime during those period. I changed my location for night reading from 1200LT to Chemical shed yet he didn‚Äôt stop coming.

                                            <i>SHE SAID YES!!!:</i> üíûüíÉü§≠<br>After collecting her number,I started calling her till February 2014,it's either she will not pick my calls or her line will be switched off. I had to beg my friend to escort me down to her hostel so as to greet her, luckily for me, I met her but with a brother inside her room, eyin fans mi, okan mi ti poruru, I felt so disturbed as in, all my thought was that the guy was her boyfriend but when I arrived, the guy decided to take his leave and I heard him say 'Anty Esther,mo ti feeee maaaa lo and she replied him, ‚Äúalright Dayo, I felt relieved cos I realised they are brother and sister from home ü§£ü§£ü§£.
As a sharp guy, I shoot my shot that night but she said she will get back to me soon, that's where wahala started oooooo, I didn‚Äôt hear any thing till after 8months of running after her, I was very very frustrated and I decided to end it. I went to my church (Oore Ofe Oluwa Baptist Church) to pray about it because I‚Äôm convinced she's the one for me, I continued pursuing her but nothing was working oo and that was the point I walked up to our then student pastor in person of Pastor Taiwo Agunloye, I explained everything to him and he prayed along with me and gave me one wicked assignment ü§£ü§£ü§£,I could remember I met with him around December 28,2014,pastor prayed for me,gave me some bible verse to use and asked me to fast on January 1st, 2nd and 3rd,ahhhhhhhhhh,I should not eat nor drink anything lojo odun, my eyes turned red that day but do I have any other option??? Definitely No,. I did exactly as pastor Taiwo said and he also gave me warning not to call her nor text her during my fasting period, he said and I quote,if she's d will of God for your life, call her a day after u finished ur fasting and prayer. At exactly 10:02pm on January 5 2015, I asked her the same question have been asking for 9months plus and she said Yes that night,as in,is this how God does wonders with prayer and fasting, I was so so happy that night.
